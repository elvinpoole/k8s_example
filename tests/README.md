# Unit Testing Guide (`tests/`)

This directory contains the automated test suite for `candiamazing`. We use **pytest**, the industry-standard framework for testing Python code.

> Note: This README does nothing for the package, you may remove it when you understand the contents.

## What is Pytest?
Pytest is a tool that finds and runs your tests. It is designed to be:
1.  **Automatic:** It crawls your directory looking for files starting with `test_` and runs them.
2.  **Simple:** You don't need to write complex classes. A test is just a function starting with `test_`.
3.  **Informative:** When a test fails, it prints a detailed breakdown of exactly *why* the values didn't match.

## How to Run Tests

From the root directory of the repository (one level up), run:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output (shows each individual test name)
pytest -v

# Run tests only in a specific file
pytest tests/test_core.py

# Run only tests that match a specific name pattern (e.g., only flux tests)
pytest -k "flux"

```

## Common Testing Patterns

If you are writing a new test, here are the standard patterns ("idioms") we use in this project.

### 1. The Basic Assertion

In older frameworks, you had to remember methods like `self.assertEqual(a, b)`. In pytest, you just use the standard Python `assert` keyword.

```python
def test_simple_math():
    x = 10
    y = 10
    assert x == y  # If this fails, pytest prints the values of x and y

```

### 2. Handling Floating Point Math (`approx`)

**Crucial for Astronomy:** Computers cannot store infinite precision. `1.0 / 3.0 * 3.0` often equals `0.999999999`, not `1.0`.
Never use `==` for floats. Use `pytest.approx()`.

```python
import pytest

def test_physics_calculation():
    result = some_complex_calculation()
    expected = 5.0
    
    # Passes if result is within 1e-6 of expected
    assert result == pytest.approx(expected)
    
    # You can also specify tolerance
    assert result == pytest.approx(expected, rel=1e-3)

```

### 3. Fixtures (Setup & Teardown)

If multiple tests need the same expensive setup (like loading a large catalog or initializing a telescope object), use a **Fixture**.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def hubble_telescope():
    """Sets up a complex object once for reuse."""
    telescope = Instrument(name="HST", zeropoint=25.0)
    return telescope

def test_observation(hubble_telescope):
    # Pytest automatically passes the return value of the fixture into the argument
    assert hubble_telescope.name == "HST"

```

### 4. Parametrization (Testing Multiple Inputs)

Instead of writing three copy-pasted tests for three different stars, use parametrization to run the same logic on a table of inputs.

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_flux, expected_mag", [
    (100.0, 20.0),
    (1000.0, 17.5),
    (10000.0, 15.0),
])
def test_flux_conversion_loop(input_flux, expected_mag):
    """Runs 3 times with different values."""
    converter = BrightnessConverter(zeropoint=25.0)
    assert converter.flux_to_mag(input_flux) == pytest.approx(expected_mag)

```

### 5. Expected Failures

Sometimes you *want* your code to crash (e.g., if a user inputs a negative flux). You should test that your code raises the correct error.

```python
def test_negative_flux_error():
    converter = BrightnessConverter(zeropoint=25.0)
    
    # The test passes ONLY if ValueError is raised inside this block
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        converter.flux_to_mag(-100.0)

```

### 6. Mocking (Faking Inputs)

Used primarily in `test_cli.py`. If a function relies on something external (like the command line `sys.argv` or an internet connection), we "mock" it to fake the input. This ensures our tests are isolated and don't depend on the environment.

We use the `monkeypatch` fixture (built-in to pytest) for this.

```python
def test_command_line(monkeypatch):
    # Fake the user typing "candiamazing --help"
    monkeypatch.setattr("sys.argv", ["candiamazing", "--help"])
    
    # Run the code
    main()

```

## Further tests

There is no end to the amount of testing you can do for your package. The more
you do, the more confident you will be that everything is working properly as
more people use your package. Above, we described a number of "Unit tests" that
check small sections of your code to see they produce the expected behaviour.
Depending on the type of package, you may also wish to run "Simulation tests"
these mock up a simulation of the load that your package will have to handle in
a more realistic scenario. They can test a full analysis pipeline run over an
intermediate example dataset. This can be useful for discovering cases where
chunks of your code, that work individually, fail to properly communicate with
each other (e.g. arguments in the wrong order). It can also check for leaks
where some state in your code isn't properly erased between runs and so in a
production scenario you find that some files get unreasonably large, or the
results start to get less accurate as configuration from previous tests leaks
through. These simulation tests can identify a number of problems before you
push to your primary resource and begin a large analysis run.
